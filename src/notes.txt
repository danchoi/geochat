ClientId should be opaque to the end user. This is mapped to a sink in
the websocket server.

Broadcast all MessageFromServer to all clients, and let client code code
stuff in the chat room depending on the UI state.

  Outgoing bandwidth may be bigger this way, but processing (selecting
  which clients to send messages to) is simpler.
