- Change the websocket server to use MonadIO instead of MVar.

  Ultimately I want the chat server to use PostgreSQL for state and persistence.

- Join Snap with Websockets with this:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/websockets-snap/0.7.0.0/doc/html/Network-WebSockets-Snap.html


  runWebSocketsSnap :: Protocol p => (Request -> WebSockets p ()) -> Snap ()Source

  The following function escapes from the current Snap handler, and continues
  processing the WebSockets action. The action to be executed takes the Request
  as a parameter, because snap has already read this from the socket.
